# Shield-Game
A small Pygame game I made in middle school
This is a game I made in Python using the Pygame library in middle school. I could not restore the original sprites. Attached on the GitHub repository are images of the original thing and the source code I found deep in the depths of my old computer. The source code is also the same as the original. I hope it can go to show how far back my passion for software development goes back to.
